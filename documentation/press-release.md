# Summary 
_Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good._\
A quick and convenient way of looking inside archive files without extracting files of unknown content onto your own machine. Having looked into the archive you can cherry-pick the files that are of interest and download a new archive that only contains the files that you need.

# Problem 
_Describe the problem your product solves._\
The product reduces the risk of unpacking an archive file on your local machine and inadvertently opening files containing malicious content. 

# Solution 
_Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem._\
Users drop the archive file onto the web page and are presented with a list of the contained filenames. The user then selects the files that they want to receive, and downloads a new archive file containing only those files. With this approach the original archive is never opened on the users local machine.

By having visibility of the archive file's manifest you can make decisions about downloading only the files that you want, rather than having to receive everything that is sent in the archive.
